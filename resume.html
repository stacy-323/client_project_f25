    <!--Cover letters-->
    <section id="cover_letters">
      <h2>Writing Professional Cover Letters</h2>
      <p>
        A cover letter complements your resume by allowing you to tell your story, share your motivations, and illustrate your fit for the specific role or organization. Unlike a resume, which lists facts, a cover letter should explain why you're interested in this position and why you're a great match.</p>
      <p>
        Start with a strong introduction -ideally addressing a specific person — and follow with one or two detailed paragraphs connecting your experiences to the job's requirements. End with a call to action, such as your desire to discuss your application further.
      </p>
        <h3>Cover Letters 101</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Address the letter to a <strong>specific person</strong> (if possible) rather than "To Whom It May Concern."</li>
          <li>Start strong with a brief introduction and statement of interest.</li>
          <li>Use <strong>one or two examples</strong> to show how your skills match the position.</li>
          <li>Keep it to one page and customize it for each application.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate enthusiasm for the position and company.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
      <!--Cover letter FAQs-->

        <h3 class="highlighted_h3">Cover Letter FAQ</h3>
        <button class="accordion">Do I need to write a new cover letter for every job application?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>While it may be tempting to use the same cover letter for multiple applications, tailoring your cover letter for each role is highly recommended. Customizing your letter allows you to address the specific requirements of the job and shows the employer that you've done your research and are genuinely interested in their organization. A well-tailored cover letter helps you stand out from other applicants.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What should I do if I don't know who to address the cover letter to?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If you're unable to find the name of the hiring manager after thorough research, it's acceptable to use a general but  professional salutation. "Dear Hiring Manager" or "Dear [Job Title] Search Committee" are commonly used alternatives. Avoid  using outdated or generic salutations like "To Whom It May Concern" when possible, as a little effort to personalize your letter can make a positive impression.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices</h3>

          <li>Select and curate your best, most <strong>relevant work</strong> for each opportunity.</li>

          <li>Keep your portfolio <strong>well-organized</strong>.</li>
          <li>Choose a user-friendly platform or website builder (such as Behance, Wix, WordPress, GitHub for code, or personal websites) and update regularly.</li>
          <li>Ensure that your portfolio is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate; consider adding a downloadable PDF version upon request.</li>

      <p>
        Your LinkedIn profile is a living document that allows you to showcase your personal brand and expand your professional  network worldwide. Unlike a resume, it offers space to highlight extracurriculars, volunteer work, personal interests, and  endorsements.</p>
      <p>
        Start with a professional headshot and a unique headline that summarizes what you do or aspire to do. Use  the summary section to introduce yourself, your goals, and what you're passionate about. Add detailed entries for your  experiences, keeping keyword optimization in mind so recruiters can find you.<br></p>
