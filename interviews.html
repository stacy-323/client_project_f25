        <h2>Understanding the Interview Process</h2>
        <p>
          Interviews are your chance to demonstrate not just your qualifications, but also your fit for a role or program. Most employers and graduate programs use interviews to learn more about your experiences, skills, and goals. Understanding the structure - whether it's in-person, virtual, one-on-one, or panel -will help you better prepare and present yourself with confidence.

        <h2>Common Interview Questions & How to Respond</h2>
        <p>
          While every interview is unique, some questions are almost always asked. Be ready to talk about your background, explain  why you're interested in the position, and discuss your strengths and areas for growth. Practice using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Bo0JkhD_Hy0ENeECJSTnAcK3OPcQyVbYC8rtqKSOUk/edit?usp=sharing">STAR method  (Situation, Task, Action, Result)</a> to answer behavioral questions clearly and effectively. Remember, the interview is also an  opportunity for you to ask thoughtful questions about the organization or role.
